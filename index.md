### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was one of the first labs we did, and it helped introduce me to coding. This was a simple lab project creating a Madlib prompt, and it was a good introduction to C++.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was also a good lab because it was the first lab that I really struggled with. This lab was also the lab I spent the most time onb. Working on these labs, parts one and two, really helped improve my coding skills. 


* Lab 10    

    Lab 10 was one of my favorite labs because it taught me how to read from and open text files in my C++ code. Although difficult to grasp at first, working on this lab has honed my C++ skills considerably.
